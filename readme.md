# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### TypeScript-webcomponent codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **TypeScript-webcomponent** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **TypeScript-webcomponent** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

This example has been heavily influenced by the [VanillaJS-WebComponent](https://github.com/gothinkster/web-components-realworld-example-app) example, altough it is not a one-to-one rewrite of it.

# How it works

The Example uses the TypeScript language with the modern WebComponent API.

# Getting started

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

or

```shell
yarn && yarn start
```
